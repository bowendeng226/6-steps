Dear Graduates:

I have been releasing for about 4 years. I felt that I had reached a peaceful place of being: little did I realize that I had just been floating above my garbage.

Just under a year ago, I found out about Larry and The Abundance Course and gave hem a call. In the past I had reached states of being sometimes for as long as a year, but rubbish would still resurface. Larry explained that I had been in a nice space but had been just floating above my garbage. I could quite easily have stayed in that space this whole lifetime, however little growth would have been made.

He explained that it was a very common pitfall of the method. You reach a nice quiet place stay there, but do not get rid of the remaining garbage. I have so much gratitude towards Larry for pointing that out to me and enabling me to continue on the journey towards freedom.

I ordered the Abundance Course and began working with tapes.

The things that Lester has spoken about started to become apparent. Larry was kind enough to word with me and started to point out to me that I was experiencing things that Lester had spoken about. Things started to open up for me. I decided to fly from England to Los Angeles to teke a Live Course and spend some time with Larry. I also ordered the Goals and Resistance course and all of the Advanced Courses.

I would like to share some of the things that have happened to encourage you to continue releasing for freedom.

The mind stilled. So what you might say. But let me expain: no more worries, doubts, recriminations, etc. Just a delightful peace. A deep sense of resting no matter what was happening. No matter what happens now there is always taht state of resting. Of being. The mind can never touch me again. It comes and goes but I know it can never touch me again.

Kam comes and goes, and that's ok too. There is deep sense of rest like in deep sleep. It is so beautiful and peaceful. This deep, deep sense of peace. It really has to be experienced to be believed.

The world is seen for what it is. A dream or drama. The drama goes on. I just watch, like sitting in a movie theater. Everything is ok. There is no need to change anything because everything is as it should be. Everything is perfect.

You start to see everybody as part of you. There is no other. There never was any other. There is only one and we are that. There is a sense of "coming back" to play the game. But this time just for having fun. There is only beingness.

Lester and all the masters are here with us. Every single second they are with us. We just have to call on them. Now there is just a resting. Things just happen, without effort.

I would encourage every one of you who has the method to continue releasing. To continue releasing until you have all the peace and joy that is rightfully yours. And this is possible this very lifetime if you would do it.

We start and then we stop. Then we start again, and then we stop. And so it goes on. This is because the decision has not been made. Once the decision has been made then the releasing momentum starts, and releasing becomes easier and easier.

The problem is you do not want it. You talk about it and think about it, but ultimately you really do not want it. If you did then there would be no stopping.

You would rather bathe in misery. You love your stories and suffering too much. Take a good look inside and see for yourself.

The method is the most powerful tool available. It is the most highest method possible. What it is? "I am not this feeling. I am not this feeling. I am not this feeling." It is stopping you indentifying with the lesser part of you.

So make the decision now, the peace and relief you will experience is ecstasy.

Love, Kam Bakhshi
